###Does your log mention database corruption?

If your Syncthing log reports panics because of database corruption it is
most likely a fault with your system's storage or memory. Affected log
entries will contain lines starting with panic: leveldb. You will need to
delete the index database to clear this, by running syncthing -reset-database.
